# Thurst Library Algorithms

## Project Description

Implemented various thrust library algorithms, such as sorting, reordering, reduction, transformation, and prefix-sum
 
The project allows to choose the size of the generated dataset and specify the needed algorithms:
```
./thrustAlgorithms <size> <algorithm> 
```
For example:
```
./thrust 100 reduction
```
